# Detailed Explanation and Documentation

## Grover's Algorithm Implementation

### Oracle Construction

The oracle in Grover's algorithm is designed to flip the phase of the marked states \( S_n \). This is achieved by applying X gates to qubits corresponding to '0' bits in the target state, followed by a multi-controlled Z gate targeting the ancilla qubit. After the phase flip, the X gates are reverted to restore the original state.

### Diffusion Operator

The diffusion operator amplifies the amplitudes of the marked states. It consists of:
1. Applying Hadamard gates to all qubits.
2. Applying X gates to all qubits.
3. Implementing a multi-controlled Z gate on the last qubit, controlled by the first \( n-1 \) qubits.
4. Reverting the X gates.
5. Reapplying the Hadamard gates.

## Threshold Comparator

The threshold comparator applies a classical threshold \( \Sigma_T \) to determine whether each state in \( S_n \) should be assigned a binary value of 0 or 1. States with values greater than or equal to \( \Sigma_T \) are assigned 1, and those below are assigned 0.

## Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm Implementation

### Oracle Construction

The oracle for the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm encodes the function \( f(x) \) as follows:
- If \( x \in S_n \), then \( f(x) = \) threshold assignment.
- If \( x \notin S_n \), then \( f(x) = \) assign_complement (either 0 or 1).

The oracle flips the phase of the ancilla qubit if \( f(x) = 1 \) using a multi-controlled Z gate.

### Algorithm Execution

1. **Initialization**: The ancilla qubit is set to \( |1\rangle \), and Hadamard gates are applied to all qubits.
2. **Oracle Application**: The constructed oracle is applied.
3. **Final Hadamard Gates**: Hadamard gates are reapplied to all qubits.
4. **Measurement**: The qubits are measured to determine if the function \( f(x) \) is constant or not.

## Simulation Workflow

1. **Grover Phase**:
   - Initialize the data qubits in a uniform superposition.
   - Apply Grover iterations (oracle + diffusion) to amplify the amplitudes of the marked states \( S_n \).
   - Measure the data qubits to observe the distribution of states.

2. **Threshold Assignment**:
   - Apply a classical threshold \( \Sigma_T \) to assign binary values to the states in \( S_n \).
   - Generate a threshold dictionary mapping each \( x \in S_n \) to 0 or 1 based on the threshold.

3. **Deutsch–Jozsa Runs**:
   - **Run 1**: Assign all states not in \( S_n \) to 0.
   - **Run 2**: Assign all states not in \( S_n \) to 1.
   - For each run, execute the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm to determine if the function is constant.

4. **Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the measurement histograms from both runs to determine if the network is quiescent, epileptic, or mixed.
